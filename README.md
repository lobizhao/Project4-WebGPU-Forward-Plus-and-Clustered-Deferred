### Features
#### Naive
Baseline forward rendering with no optimizations. Tests every light against every fragment, resulting in poor performance with many lights but simple implementation.

Workflow:
- Single render pass with brute-force lighting
- Test ALL lights against EVERY fragment
- **Complexity**: O(fragments Ã— lights)

#### Forward Plus
Optimized forward rendering using light clustering. Divides screen into tiles and assigns lights to tiles, dramatically reducing per-fragment light tests while maintaining forward rendering benefits.

Workflow:
- Compute Pass: Assign lights to screen-space tiles (16Ã—9 grid)
- Render Pass: For each fragment, determine tile and test only relevant lights

#### Clustered Deferred
Most efficient approach combining deferred shading with light clustering. Decouples geometry processing from lighting calculations, ideal for complex scenes with high light counts and overdraw.

Workflow:
- Compute Pass: Assign lights to screen-space tiles
- Buffer Pass: Render geometry data to textures (position, normal, albedo)
- Fullscreen Pass: Read G-Buffer, determine tile, calculate lighting only for visible pixels
- Advantage: Geometry processed once, lighting calculated only for visible pixels

#### Bloom

  Bloom - base on Box blur
</div>
Post-processing effect that creates realistic glow around bright light sources, enhancing visual quality and realism.

Workflow:
- Extract Pass: Isolate pixels brighter than threshold
- Blur Pass: Apply 11Ã—11 box blur to bright areas
- Composite Pass: Blend blurred bloom with original scene

Implementation Files:
- `bloom_extract.fs.wgsl` - Extracts bright pixels above threshold using luminance calculation
- `bloom_blur.fs.wgsl` - Applies 11Ã—11 box blur kernel for smooth glow effect
- `bloom_composite.fs.wgsl` - Combines original scene with blurred bloom (80% intensity)

### Analysis

#### Performance Comparison

  Performance Comparison: Frame Time vs Number of Lights
</div>

**Naive Rendering**: Exhibits the worst performance with linear scaling (O(n)). Frame time increases dramatically from 28.61ms (500 lights) to 288.33ms (5000 lights), making it unsuitable for scenes with many lights.

**Forward+**: Shows significant improvement over Naive through light clustering, reducing frame time by ~40% at 500 lights. However, performance still degrades linearly with light count, reaching 177.50ms at 5000 lights.

**Clustered Deferred**: Demonstrates superior performance and scalability. Maintains near-constant frame time (~16.66ms) up to 2000 lights due to deferred shading's ability to process only visible pixels. Even at 5000 lights (34.17ms), it outperforms Naive by 8.4Ã— and Forward+ by 5.2Ã—.

Clustered Deferred is the clear winner for high light count scenarios, maintaining consistent performance where other methods struggle. The G-Buffer approach eliminates redundant lighting calculations on occluded geometry, making it ideal for complex scenes with significant overdraw.

#### Memory Usage Analysis

  Memory Usage Comparison
</div>

**Naive**: Most memory-efficient (173.4 MB total) due to minimal data structures. Only stores basic scene geometry and lighting data without additional optimization structures.

**Forward+**: Moderate memory footprint (424.1 MB). Texture memory increases 2.7Ã— due to screen-space tile data structures. Buffer memory doubles to store cluster-light assignments for the 16Ã—9 tile grid.

**Clustered Deferred**: Highest memory usage (497.7 MB) but best performance. Texture memory (182.5 MB) stores G-Buffer (position, normal, albedo textures). Buffer memory (315.2 MB) is 5Ã— larger than Naive due to cluster data structures and deferred rendering buffers.

Memory usage scales with optimization complexity. Clustered Deferred trades ~2.9Ã— more memory than Naive for 8.4Ã— better performance at high light counts, demonstrating an excellent performance-to-memory ratio for demanding scenes.
